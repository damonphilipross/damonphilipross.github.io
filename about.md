# About

Hi, I'm Damon Ross.

I'm a software engineer and former founder based in the Australia/New Zealand region.

Over the last decade, I've worked across the entire company lifecycle—from being the first engineer at raw startups to navigating the complexities of multi-million line enterprise codebases. I enjoy the "cold start" problem of new ventures just as much as I enjoy the architectural puzzles found in scaling systems.

My interests gravitate toward economics, big messy data projects, and statistics. I’m particularly drawn to "punts" any ambitious, crazy ideas that aim to shake up how things work.

I use this blog to share technical breakdowns of the projects I’m building. If you’re working on something interesting and need someone who can jump into the deep end of a complex problem, I’d love to hear from you.

You can get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damon-ross-237b7b155/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://x.com/damindestress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, or <span class="email-display">{{ site.email | replace: "@", '<span style="display:none">null</span>@' }}</span>.
