## A brief about me

Hey, my name is Damon. I like to solve problems, make products, and get what I've made into the hands
of people who need it. My primary focus is in data science, web-apps and sensors. I generally use Python or
Javascript for my projects. I got into tech as a product manager, studied computer science, launched a product
to teach myself to code and went to the Le Wagon bootcamp.

I've worked in a range of fields, including finance, energy, and law. The tech stack I have used across different projects includes (but not limited to)

**Data Science**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, spaCy, Sklearn, Tensorflow, OpenCV

**Webapps**: Flask, Node.js, AWS, Heroku, Express, Sentry, Passport.js, Mocha/Chai

**DB**: Postgresql

**For sensors**: Raspberry pi, arduino, various digital and analogue sensors


However I always make it a priority to find the right tools for the project.
