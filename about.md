## A brief about me

Hey, my name is Damon. I like to solve problems, make products, and get what I've made into the hands
of people who need it. My primary focus is in data science, web-apps and messing around with sensors.

I've worked in a range of fields, including finance, energy, and law. Some of the tech I like to use includes
Python, Pandas, Numpy SpaCy, Node.js, AWS, Heroku among others. However I always make it a priority to find the right tools for the project.

### More Information

You can find more detailed info with my cv or by emailing me.
