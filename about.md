## A brief about me

Hey, my name is Damon. I like to solve problems, make products, and get what I've made into the hands
of people who need it. My primary focus is in data science, web-apps and messing around with sensors.

I've worked in a range of fields, including finance, energy, and law. Some of the tech I like to use includes (but not limited to)

**Data Science**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, spaCy, Sklearn, Tensorflow

**Webapps**: Flask, Node.js, AWS, Heroku, Express, Sentry, Passport.js, Mocha/Chai

**DB**: Postgresql, Mongodb

**Sensors**: Raspberry pi's, arduino's


However I always make it a priority to find the right tools for the project.
