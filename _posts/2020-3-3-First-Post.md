## Shit

I first heard about widespread employment issues from a report from NZ's Ministry of Employment stating 17% of the population was having their employment rights infringed upon.

After interviewing some employment lawyers, and people who have had employment problems some key problems appeared in the flow of people trying to get help. The process for a person in employment trouble would go

- questions were montonous for lawyers
  - asked lawyers what questions they ask for different legal problems
  - noted similarities
  - created a scoring system
- clients needed to be guided but also needed an online solution (nowhere to get help on specific but common issues, )
  - big problem with people being able to find legal help quickly
  - information confusing, dense but commonalities across problems
  - abstracting questions
- building an MVP and creating a business model (talking to lawyers and discovering what they did and didn't want, Redesigning the app after talking to clients)
  - monteizing was going to be referring cases through to lawyers and taking a percentage. The idea was that the questions would reduce lawyer time and uncertainty
- What went wrong
  - Idea suffered a marketing problem How do you get this in front of people who may only have this problem once in their lives?
- A suitable endpoint
  - shutting down and collaborting with citizen ai
- Lessons for others
  - Law suffers from a marketing problem
  - distrubting law is more about insitutional change then a core produt.
