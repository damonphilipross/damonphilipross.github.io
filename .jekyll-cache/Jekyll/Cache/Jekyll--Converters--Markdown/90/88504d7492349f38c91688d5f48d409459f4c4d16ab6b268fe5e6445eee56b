<p>I first heard about widespread employment issues from a report from NZ’s Ministry of Employment stating 17% of the population was having their employment rights infringed upon.</p>

<p>After interviewing some employment lawyers, and people who have had employment problems some key problems appeared in the flow of people trying to get help. The process for a person in employment trouble would go</p>

<ul>
  <li>questions were montonous for lawyers
    <ul>
      <li>asked lawyers what questions they ask for different legal problems</li>
      <li>noted similarities</li>
      <li>created a scoring system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>clients needed to be guided but also needed an online solution (nowhere to get help on specific but common issues, )
    <ul>
      <li>big problem with people being able to find legal help quickly</li>
      <li>information confusing, dense but commonalities across problems</li>
      <li>abstracting questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>building an MVP and creating a business model (talking to lawyers and discovering what they did and didn’t want, Redesigning the app after talking to clients)
    <ul>
      <li>monteizing was going to be referring cases through to lawyers and taking a percentage. The idea was that the questions would reduce lawyer time and uncertainty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What went wrong
    <ul>
      <li>Idea suffered a marketing problem How do you get this in front of people who may only have this problem once in their lives?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A suitable endpoint
    <ul>
      <li>shutting down and collaborting with citizen ai</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lessons for others
    <ul>
      <li>Law suffers from a marketing problem</li>
      <li>distrubting law is more about insitutional change then a core produt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
