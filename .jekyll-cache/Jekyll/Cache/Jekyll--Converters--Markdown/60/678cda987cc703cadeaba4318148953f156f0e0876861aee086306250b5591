<p>Hey, my name is Damon. I like to solve problems, make products, and get what I’ve made into the hands
of people who need it. My primary focus is in data science, web-apps and sensors. I generally use Python or
Javascript for my projects.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in a range of fields, including finance, energy, and law. The tech stack I have used across different projects includes (but not limited to)</p>

<p><strong>Data Science</strong>: Python, Pandas, Numpy, spaCy, Sklearn, Tensorflow</p>

<p><strong>Webapps</strong>: Flask, Node.js, AWS, Heroku, Express, Sentry, Passport.js, Mocha/Chai</p>

<p><strong>DB</strong>: Postgresql</p>

<p><strong>For sensors</strong>: Raspberry pi, arduino</p>

<p>However I always make it a priority to find the right tools for the project.</p>
