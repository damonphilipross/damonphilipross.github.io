<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I consulted to a Law Firm that wanted to automate their creation of legal documents so they could reduce error rates within documents and bring new hires up to speed faster.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>To find the best solution for automation I shadowed two employees on their document creation process. I then abstracted commonalities across documents to find where the similarities were and what could be gathered from their clients once and populated across multiple documents. This gave me an initial feature-set to build. We then iterated the prototype to meet the client requirements for UX, and functionality.</p>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decreasing document creation time from 4 hours to 30 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documenting processes and â€˜how toâ€™ guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automating an end to end process from receiving a client, gathering information about them, and then producing ausable legal document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working with end users to make the system user friendly, including abstracting their legal process and reusing dataacross documents for efficiency gains.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>*Creating a sidebar, and roadmap for easier navigation so users can see what stage they are on with a case</p>
