Product manager for Hireroom a technical recruitment app. Was in charge of prototyping, building and taking Hireroom to market.


### Background

I was tasked with getting Hireroom, a product of Lancom Technology, off the ground with the goal of it becoming astand-alone company. My day to day involved a mix of product management, marketing and improving the employer andcandidate experience on the Hireroom platform. When I started on Hireroom it was just a small technical test. The goal of Hireroom was to become a profit making company.

### Developent

To start I performed a benchmark study on current technical recruiting solutions and conducted research to get an idea of the landscape and problems that are being addressed. To get the requirements for the features I interviewed people job searching to discover their pain points, as well as the issues companies have during the hiring process. I compiled a list of complaints and created a minimal feature list to launch the product with. Wireframes were built using pen and paper and later sketched out with a ux designer using photoshop. I then wrote the user stories and used an internal press release to provide a strong narrative for each features purpose. I then redeveloped the pricing strategy to be value based to match the rates companies were paying to have positions filled.

### Outcome

With the changes I made above within its first month Hireroom achieved:

* Made $15,500 in its first month half of which was profit.

* Increaesd website visits 178%

* Grew the user base approximate rate of 5% week on week during my time in charge.
